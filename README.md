# PitchPerfect
This is project 1 for the online iOS Develoepr Nano Degree program from Udacity.
This project allows the user to record thier voice, and manipulate it with six different effects. 
The effects are:
<br> 1) Rabbit (speed up)
<br> 2) Snail (slowed down)
<br>  3) Chipmonk (high pitched)
<br>  4) Vader (low pitched)
<br>  5) Echo
<br>  6) Reverb
The user can only use one effect at a time. Future imporvements could be allow the user to choose multiple effects, 
and add more choice by allowing the user to select how much the speed can be slowed down or speed up, and same for the 
other effects.
